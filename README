NUMBRIX is a numbrix solver written in Common Lisp for CAP4621 (Artifical Intelligence, Fall 2008) at the University of Florida.
My partner (Brian Ethier) and I were both new to Common Lisp, so the code is non-idiomatic, decidedly un-functional, and downright messy.
Enter at your own risk. :-)

REQUIREMENTS:
   * Common Lisp
   * clisp (if you'd like to compile it down to bytecode):
         http://clisp.cons.org/

INSTALLATION/USAGE:

To run in clisp:
   1) Open up the clisp interpreter (`clisp`)
   2) Type:
      (compile-file "numbrix.lisp")
   3) Type: 
      (load "numbrix.fas")
   4) The main program is called 'numbrix'. To run it, type:
      (numbrix)
   5) To use the board from Dankel's project specification, you can either enter
      "oct20.board" or no value at all when prompted for a filename.
      
      IMPORTANT: The tournament boards are named #.board, where # is the number specified
      in the tournament dataset document.

   5) For actual gameplay instructions, type 'h' at the move prompt in the game.

   For automatic (computer) play: press 'a' at the move prompt.

   NOTE: When the board is complete and the solution is incorrect, the board state is
         reset (set back to the original configuration).

Sample boards can be found in boards/.
